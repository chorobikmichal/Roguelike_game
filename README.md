## Compilation:
Run the make command (it automatically executes it from within the make file)

## to execute the program run
./run ../assets/input.txt

## Usage:
To use this program input the name of a text file with the level data. 
Then once the game board appears use wasd keays to control the character 
printed on the screen and interact with the game. You can press q to quit at any point.

## Known limitations:
You can't input any other file names than text files.
There has to be a file name passed as an argument or there is a set fault

## Testing:
I used different combinations of items and parameters to ensure that my program works 
at all times that it should. This is the list of those combinations. I put multiple items 
like big gold or the character to check if they would print more then once which they don't.
Also i put multiple doors in each room to see if they would print and work propertly. Lastly I
printed the character in a room other then the first one to check if the teleportation from door to door would work.
